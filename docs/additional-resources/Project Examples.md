# Project Examples

Here are some examples of projects that have been built using DelphinusLab's tools and technologies:

1. [Hello World](https://github.com/riddles-are-us/helloworld-rollup): A simple rollup application that serves as the perfect starting point for beginners. We recommend this as your first project to understand the basics of DelphinusLab's tools and technologies. Follow our [quick tutorial](../getting-started/Quick%20Tutorial.md) to get started.

2. [Automata](https://github.com/riddles-are-us/zkwasm-automata): A comprehensive mining game that demonstrates the implementation of time-driven events. This project showcases how to handle time-based mechanics in zkWasm applications.

3. [MemeDisco](https://github.com/riddles-are-us/puppy-party): An interactive gaming platform that allows users to create and customize their own memes. This project demonstrates the integration of user-generated content within zkWasm.

4. [Autocombat](https://github.com/riddles-are-us/autocombat): An automatic battle game that implements random number generation. This project showcases how to handle randomness in zkWasm applications while maintaining fairness and transparency.

5. [Tower Defence](https://github.com/riddles-are-us/zkwasm-towerdefence): A classic tower defense game implementation that demonstrates complex game logic and state management using zkWasm technology.

## Getting Started with the Projects

To run any of these example projects, follow these steps:

1. **Project Setup**

    - Clone the repository of your chosen project
    - Review the project's README.md file for any project-specific requirements
    - Familiarize yourself with the codebase structure

2. **Environment Setup**

    - Install all required [dependencies](../getting-started/Setup%20Environment.md)
    - Ensure your development environment meets the system requirements

3. **Build and Run**

    - Follow the same steps as outlined in our [quick tutorial](../getting-started/Quick%20Tutorial.md)
    - Instead of using the template project code, use the code from your chosen example project
    - Pay attention to any project-specific configuration or setup steps mentioned in the project's documentation

For the best learning experience, we recommend starting with the Hello World project before moving on to more complex examples.
