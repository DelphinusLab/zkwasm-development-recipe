This Development Recipe will start from scratch, from understanding blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs, to learning the basics and architecture of zkWasm, and then to developing a complete application, allowing you to transform from a beginner to an advanced zkWasm developer. Of course, this Development Recipe can serve as both an introductory tutorial for beginners and a reference manual for developing zkWasm applications. Each chapter corresponds to a step in developing a full-stack zkWasm application. Learning Experience Here's what you can expect from this recipe: Workflow : A smooth development learning experience following a \"learn - design - develop - test - deploy\" workflow Tools : Useful tools and guidance for developing games, web, and backend applications Guidance : Step-by-step code examples and practical guidance Content Format: Text : Clear and concise explanations to help you understand the concepts and principles Code : Step-by-step code examples to guide you through the development process Video : Visual explanations to help you understand the concepts and principles Quiz : Test your understanding of the concepts and principles Supplemental Resources : Additional resources to further enhance your learning FAQ : Answers to frequently asked questions You will build skills and confidence in the following areas: Blockchain and zkWasm engineering Application design Frontend development with React, TypeScript, and Web3 libraries Backend development with Rust and zkWasm Environment setup, testing, debugging, and deployment This will equip you to build your own zkWasm applications from the ground up. Upon completing this Development Recipe, you'll have several exciting paths to explore: Hackathons : Put your skills to the test by participating in hackathons across various ecosystems and showcasing your zkWasm prowess Entrepreneurship : Embark on an entrepreneurial journey by building your own innovative products and starting a company, with the support of Delphinus Labs Ecosystem Contribution : Contribute to the growth of the zkWasm ecosystem by creating essential tools and libraries, with grants from Delphinus Labs Launch your career as a sought-after full-stack developer in the thriving blockchain industry Academic Research : Delve deeper into the academic realm by pursuing research on zkWasm and pushing the boundaries of this cutting-edge technology Discover Opportunities : Discover countless other opportunities to apply your newfound expertise and make your mark in the world of blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs Ready to get started? Here are a few steps you should follow to ensure a great development experience: Join the Discord Community Delphinus Labs Discord Community Ask questions, share your ideas, and get help from the community. \"The best way to learn is by teaching.\u201d If you see others who are stuck, help them out! There are also many events and activities organized by the community which you can participate in. Join the Telegram Dev Chat Please DM The Developer Relations Team Direct Message the developer relations team to be invited into the telegram chat group. You can get help from the developer relations team, also you will be able to connect with other developers.
